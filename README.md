# Shiny Visualization Project

This repository contains the Shiny-based interactive visualization system developed for the dissertation project on Probability and Statistics Education.  
It provides an intuitive platform for exploring probability distributions through visualization, interaction, and storytelling.

## Project Overview

The Shiny application helps students learn key probability concepts through simulation and dynamic visualization.  
Users can interactively manipulate parameters, visualize how probability functions change, and explore statistical relationships in real time.

### Core Modules

| Module | Description |
|:--------|:-------------|
| **Main Application (`main.R`)** | Integrates all modules into a unified Shiny dashboard. |
| **Probability Distribution (`module_probability.R`)** | Visualizes major discrete and continuous distributions, including Bernoulli, Binomial, Poisson, and Normal. |
| **Game: Discrete (`module_game_discrete.r`)** | An interactive detective-style probability game that strengthens conceptual understanding through contextual tasks. |
| **Joint Distribution (`module_joint.R`)** | Enables users to construct and explore joint PMFs, marginal, and conditional distributions. |
| **Conditional Distribution (`module_conditional.R`)** | Demonstrates how conditional probabilities evolve based on different given conditions. |
| **Expectation (`module_expectation.R`)** | Allows learners to compute and visualize expectations of random variables using table-based PMFs. |

## Academic Context

This project was developed as part of a Master’s dissertation focused on enhancing probability and statistics learning through interactive visualization.  
It combines statistical theory, pedagogical design, and data-driven user interaction using R and Shiny.

For detailed methodology, educational design, and system architecture, please refer to the dissertation document.
